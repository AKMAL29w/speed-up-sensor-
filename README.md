# Fast Gyroscope

Fast Gyroscope is an LSPosed module that increases the response speed of the gyroscope sensor on Android devices. Designed to improve the gaming experience such as PUBG Mobile and other FPS games that rely on aiming using the gyro.

# Features

Speed up gyroscope response time (low latency)

Increase accuracy and stability of sensor input

Save battery compared to tweaks that speed up all sensors

# Compatibility

Android 10 and above

LSPosed + Riru/Zygisk

Does not work on devices without a hardware gyroscope sensor

# Installation

1. Make sure LSPosed is installed on your device.

2. Install the Fast Gyroscope module.

3. Enable the module for the target application such as PUBG Mobile or other games that use the gyro.

4. No Need to Reboot the Device.

# Note

If you are using other tweak modules that change all sensors (such as "Sensor Faster"), it is recommended to disable them to avoid conflicts.

This module does not permanently modify the system and can be disabled at any time via LSPosed Manager.
